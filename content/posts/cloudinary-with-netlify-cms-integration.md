Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Stay focused. Give thanks to the most high. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. Let’s see what Chef Dee got that they don’t want us to eat.

Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it.

The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Give thanks to the most high. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Fan luv. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Congratulations, you played yourself. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it.
