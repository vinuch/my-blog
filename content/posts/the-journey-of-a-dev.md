Hey there my name is Vincent Edeh and I am a Frontend developer based in Nigeria üá≥üá¨.I‚Äôm currently pursuing a degree in computer science at the Federal University of Technology Owerri and it‚Äôs my third year there. I think that‚Äôs as much as it goes for a bio for me üòÖthere‚Äôs really not much, but I‚Äôm not writing this article to tell you a bunch of boring facts about me. I want to write about how I got into tech, basically how I started coding and my journey so far. Looking back it‚Äôs been two years already and I can barely remember how it all started but I‚Äôm hoping this article is something for future me to read and remember what we went through finding our feet in the tech industry also im hoping this helps inspire somebody out there learning a new skill to keep pushing. well let‚Äôs get into it.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CNxAJZOnlCKEHgSoCoLh8D4Q7qvHO4z8ae3pLp3sRiu9Vz8gFrHgUz6HQqMihOQNbcOLcknfw83aRDVJqf3LlnTiZvLACNSmrhYQGrQHu4ZABmgSbSlsn11BS8vBTPQaK7unPusL)



FIRST YEAR OF UNI(2017)

It all started when I got into uni, before then I had no clue about coding or anything like that. I didn't even play video games but I had a laptop that was basically my second TV, all I did on it was watch movies . So getting to school was a bit difficult for me, you know navigating campus as a first year and all that hassle I also had to make new friends which sadly I suck at. After a while I made a few and One of them was chijioke, we were in the same department and level so we hit it off in school then once in a while i‚Äôd go to his place to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with some other guys from our class, they would take turns to beat me in FIFA (on my own laptop!!!) and we would have fun. After a while I noticed that chijioke was a programmer, I kind of figured it out from watching what he did on his laptop and it was absolutely fascinating to watch. I asked him about it and he told me how he spent 2years at a bootcamp learning to code before he came to school, At this point i was really eager to learn more about coding but I didn‚Äôt have two years to attend a bootcamp neither could i afford it, so i started googling stuff like ‚ÄúLearn How to code ONLINE ‚Äù and ‚ÄúLearn How to code FOR FREE ‚Äù I came across a ton of free learning materials from youtube videos to freecodecamp so I dived in head first and started absorbing as much as I could at every chance I‚Äôd get on my phone, laptop and occasionally on paper so i could save the battery of my devices as light was a big issue in school. Before I knew it I was asking my friend chijioke questions about problems I had run into with HTML and CSS, and he‚Äôd help me find answers and feed me some encouragement to keep going and I did. I felt like a kid learning to ride a bike again anytime I made something cool, I‚Äôd want to show it to somebody, anybody driven by my curiosity and pure excitement, I kept learning and learning and learning.



Internship and Communities



By 2018 the next year I had gotten my footing in the frontend development and needed to connect with like minds.My friend chijioke at the time had left school to pursue his career as a developer and I felt kind of alone again because I didn't really have anybody else to talk coding with, So I started looking for other coders I mean there had to be more developers on campus, and I was right I was able to get intouch with some people in my department that were also writing code Christian, Micheal to name a few. Around the same time I found out about the Andela Learning Community (ALC) scholarship that presented people with free learning material to improve as developers. I applied and got in and it was a really great experience as they had frequent meetups some of my first where I got to meet other members of the owerri dev community and alot of learning content to digest. I enjoyed the experience even though I did not make it to the final phase, I actually learnt a lot.

Towards the second half of the year i applied for a 6month internship at Oluaka Institute, a hub close to my school and it was a free internship all they asked for was commitment till the end of the programme. I got an email to come for the interview two days before the day when I was at home in Lagos. I travelled down to owerri for the interview and after a few days an email came that I had made it in and that was how I became an intern at Oluaka Institute.

Now at the time I was in my second year of uni and i didnt exactly have six months to give but because of the nature of my class schedule I was able to juggle both, by attending the hub in the mornings and normal classes in the afternoons.

It was an awesome learning experience in general, the hub‚Äôs space was comfortable the other interns were really helpful and the tutors were the best shout out to Mr John Nnanna and Mr Igwe ugwuru for everything they were able to teach us over that short period of time.



I joined the core team for the google developer students clubs in my school after my Internship and I have been trying to contribute to the growth of the dev community in owerri through volunteering and sometimes speaking.



I also enjoy attending developer conferences and hackathons as it helps me connect with other developers from different places all over nigeria some conferences Ive attended recently areCONCATENATE CONF(2019)

I also recently participated in the gensys tech hub hackathon themed Hackmania where I go to compete up to the finals with other people from other schools



So far its been an amazing journey learning to code has helped me find a way to contribute to society in my own little way and I hope to learn more and improve over this global pandemic period.





I have also recently been accepted as an intern in the genesys Codname Learnable internship and i start on monday remotely for the next six months. I am really excited for the learning I am about to experience with this and I look forward to the next phase of my dev journey.

Thats it for now and I hope to write more soon so till then bye üëã
