              Hello My name is Vincent Edeh, my friends call me vince. I am a Software Engineer from Nigeria. <br>
              <br> I mostly specialize in the frontend web development space, with technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript(vueJS). I have a knack for bringing eye catching
              UI designs to life and I am keen on learning about web accessibility, performance and basically creating 
              a more delighting experience on the web for everybody. <br> <br> This blog is my way of sharing all the information and interesting 
              stuff Ive learnt overtime with the hopes that it helps somebody in the future. <small><i>(probably even meüòÖ).</i></small> <br> It's built with gridsome, tailwindcss and deployed on netlify it also uses netlifyCMS for content management.
              <br><br>
              when im not coding I'm either playing basketball somewhere, watching a romantic comedy at home or just scrolling aimelessly on <a href="https://twitter.com/_DEVince">twitter</a> üòÅ.
              <br><br>
              so yeah thats basically what I'm about, stick around and I really hope you enjoy the content, also I'd really apprecieate feedback in the comments.
