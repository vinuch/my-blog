Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and Iâ€™m never giving up, Iâ€™m just getting started. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Stay focused. Give thanks to the most high. We donâ€™t see them, we will never see them. Always remember in the jungle thereâ€™s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. Letâ€™s see what Chef Dee got that they donâ€™t want us to eat.

Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, itâ€™s a cold world out there. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Find peace, life is like a water fall, youâ€™ve gotta flow. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and Iâ€™m never giving up, Iâ€™m just getting started. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it.

The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Iâ€™m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. Give thanks to the most high. The key is to enjoy life, because they donâ€™t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they donâ€™t want you to jetski, they donâ€™t want you to smile. Fan luv. Major key, donâ€™t fall for the trap, stay focused. Itâ€™s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Congratulations, you played yourself. Life is what you make it, so letâ€™s make it.
